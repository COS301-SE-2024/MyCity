# Project Overview
<details>
<summary><p>MyCity will revolutionise the way municipalities, communities, and third-party vendors and organisations manage, repair and track assets, by acting as a single point of contact to allow users to log tickets related to these assets, and provide updates while the ticket is in progress.</p> </summary>

<p>The system will be designed to handle a wide range of assets for multiple municipalities, allowing users to easily log tickets to report faults and other issues from potholes to transformers.  By using either desktop or mobile devices, MyCity will allow users and municipalities to flag issues relating to assets in their communities, providing updates on progress to reported tickets, increasing the efficiency for both users and all stakeholders.</p>

<p>At the heart of the system is a robust tracking mechanism. Users can report or create assets, which are then logged into the system. A ticketing system will be used to manage these assets, tracking all communication related to them between users and organisations.  Each asset will have a GPS-location associated with it.  This will enable the system to consolidate related issues and reports, reducing the noise caused by multiple users opening different tickets referring to the same asset and issue. This real-time tracking and reporting mechanism will ensure that faults and tickets are addressed promptly and efficiently.</p>

<p>The system will feature a guest capability, allowing even those without a registered account to search and report issues in their area quickly and effortlessly. This inclusive approach ensures that anyone can contribute to the betterment of their community.  Users are able to verify existing reports and tickets by up-voting or down-voting, and by doing so will increase/decrease their priority.</p>

<p>One of the standout features of the system is its GPS enabled mapping capability. Each asset and report will be associated with a GPS location, enabling users to obtain directions from their location to any asset using the inbuilt map functionality of the app. This feature not only makes it easier for users to locate assets but also aids in efficient asset management.</p>

<p>An additional feature that could offer potential benefits, and is open for discussion, would be the ability to upload a photo of the asset or fault at the location of the asset.  With the ability to upload a photo with a ticket, the stakeholders would easily be able to verify the authenticity of the report, and to act and prioritise accordingly.</p>
